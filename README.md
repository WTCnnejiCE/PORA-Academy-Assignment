# PORA-Academy-Assignment
DS-ML Gen Class
This is how I did my assignment:
I logged into my GitHub account.
Clicked on the '+' sign on the top right of the GitHub web interface and selected New repository
I then filled in the details requested on the form that popped up including repository name and description, and ticked the box to add a README.md file to this my new repository.
Then I scrolled to the bottom page and selected create repository.
having created the repository, I added this write-up you're reading by clicking the edit icon on the README.
Then, I wrote my assignment in the main repository.
Thank you.
