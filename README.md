# PORA-Academy-Assignment
## DS-ML Gen Class
### This is how I did my assignment:
1. I logged into my GitHub account.
2. Clicked on the '+' sign on the top right of the GitHub web interface and selected New repository
3. I then filled in the details requested on the form that popped up including repository name and description, and ticked the box to add a README.md file to this my new repository.
4. Then I scrolled to the bottom page and selected create repository.
5. Having created the repository, I added this write-up you're reading by clicking the edit icon on the README.
6. Then, I wrote my assignment in the main repository.
Thank you.
